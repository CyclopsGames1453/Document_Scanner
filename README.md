# Here's how the application works:

-The program uses the OpenCV library to define and process the document image.

-The program uses the numpy library for mathematical operations.

-Applies image processing techniques to detect the edges and contours of the document in the uploaded image.

-Once the document is detected, the program extracts the perspective transform to obtain a top-down view of the document.
